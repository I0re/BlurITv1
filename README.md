# Blurify

The First Version of the Blurify Project (Basic OpenCV Implementation for Computer Vision Using Haarcasade Models for Facial Detection)

This project is meant to ask the user for a video file input, detect faces within the video, and blur the faces that are detected.

This tool managed to successfully detect and blur faces from the test.mp4 file but failed to detect and blur faces from talking.mp4.
